ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WaffleAtomico, Oscar

-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a student interested in app development, web design, and team projects. I enjoy learning and discover the possible aplications of what i learn.

-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, and React. Next, I plan to study PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and as a second language, Golang.

-ðŸ’ž Although Iâ€™m working independently right now, Iâ€™m open to collaborating on new projects and exploring interesting opportunities.
