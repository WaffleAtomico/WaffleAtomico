👋 Hi, I’m @WaffleAtomico
👀 I’m interested in app development, web design, and team projects. I love learning new languages and technologies.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, focusing on Django. Next, I plan to study PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and as a second language, Golang.
💞️ Although I’m studying independently right now, I’m open to collaborating on new projects and exploring interesting opportunities.
📫 You can reach me on Instagram as @skakievich.
